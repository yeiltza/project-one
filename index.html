    <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a first generation college student. I begun my college career at UIC, and
        believed I wanted to pursue a degree in software engineering. As I began taking
        courses related to the degree, I soon realized that I greatly disliked it. I
        then switched into the opposite side of the spectrum and on my second year
        decided I would change my major to Criminology and Law. I once more hated it.
