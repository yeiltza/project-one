      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a first generation college student. I began my college career at UIC, and
          believed I wanted to pursue a degree in software engineering. As I began
          taking courses related to the degree, I soon realized that I greatly disliked
          them. I then switched into the opposite side of the spectrum and on my second
          year decided I would change my major to Criminology and Law. In the
          end I disliked it as well.
